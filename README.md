# VectorMindAi

Static site for VectorMind AI — a small static landing page.

- Repo: https://github.com/josephbickley33-web/VectorMindAi

Live deploy options
- Vercel: import this repository in your Vercel dashboard (Project → Import Git Repository). After import the site will get a Vercel subdomain. `vercel.json` is included to help Vercel detect the static site.
- GitHub Pages: this repo contains a GitHub Actions workflow that will publish the `main` branch to GitHub Pages automatically. The pages URL will be:

  https://josephbickley33-web.github.io/VectorMindAi

Quick local commands
```bash
npm install
npm start   # serves at http://localhost:8080

If you want me to connect and configure the Vercel project or add a custom domain, tell me the domain name and whether you want me to add DNS instructions to this README.
